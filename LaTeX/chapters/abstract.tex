A summary of the research question and the important findings.
Maximum 1(!) page, contains spoilers. 

A deep reinforcement learning algorithm will get implemented to train an agent to learn tasks in a real world simulation environment. 
Different reward functions will get developed and tested to solve these tasks.
An analysis which reward function suits best for a certain task and why will be done.
The implemented state of the art algorithm might be Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient \cite{Fujimoto2018}.
