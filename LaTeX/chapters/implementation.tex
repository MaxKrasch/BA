Figure \ref{fig:TD3_pseudo} shows the rough structure of the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. It is an off policy actor critic method based the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm \cite{lillicrap2015continuous}, with the enhancements of using Double Q-learning for the actors, delayed policy updates and target policy smoothing \cite{fujimoto2018}.

\subsection{Initializing actor and critic networks}
To initialize the actor and the critic, artificial neural networks are used.

\textbf{Artificial Neural Networks:}
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in simple terms is a biologically inspired
computational model, which consists of processing elements (called neurons), and
connections between them with coefficients (weights) bound to the connections.
These connections constitute the neuronal structure and attached to this structure are
training and recall algorithms. Neural networks are called the connectionist models
because of the connections found between the neurons
