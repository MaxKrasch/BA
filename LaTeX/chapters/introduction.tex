\chapter{Introduction}

Learning by interacting with their environment is a fundamental learning method for human beings and animals. Taking actions and getting a response from their environment which afterwards can get memorised is how infants learn from the day they are born \cite{sutton2018reinforcement}.

For a few years now, technology has advanced to a point where machines can also achieve the ability to learn from taking actions in a certain environment. This subject of research, which is a form of machine learning is called reinforcement learning (RL) and gained high popularity over the last decade as researchers have shown that you can achieve higher scores at video games \cite{mnih2013playing} than human experts by using reinforcement learning and also that you can build chess and go engines that beat every human player and every elite computer engine that existed before \cite{silver2018general}. 

In this thesis a reinforcement learning algorithm will be implemented to train an agent to make an robot run and jump in a certain environment. After the implementation, an analysis will be done in which different reward functions will be tested in respect to the pace the robot can achieve in a certain time of learning and how high it will be able to jump.
